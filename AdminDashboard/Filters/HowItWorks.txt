How it works:
	1. The [Authorize(Policy = "Content.Read")] attribute triggers a request for the policy named "Permissions.Products.Read"

	2. The PermissionPolicyProvider intercepts this request and creates a new AuthorizationPolicy with a PermissionRequirement("Permissions.Products.Read")

	3. This policy is passed to the PermissionAuthorizationHandler, which checks if the user has the corresponding claim (Permission. Products.Read).

	4. If the user has this permission, they are authorized to access the resource.
